                <h1>The Facts abouts sky</h1>
                <p>Here are some fascinating facts about the sky:
                
                Natural Phenomena
                
                1. Sunsets are not actually the sun setting: The sun remains stationary; what we see is the Earth rotating, causing the
                sun to appear as if it's setting.
                2. The sky is not blue: It appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, where shorter wavelengths of
                light (like blue and violet) are scattered by atmospheric particles.
                3. Clouds can weigh a lot: A single cumulus cloud can weigh as much as 1 million pounds (450,000 kg) of water.
                
                Astronomical Facts
                
                1. The sky contains over 2,500 stars visible to the naked eye: However, only about 2,000 can be seen from a single
                location on Earth.
                2. The Milky Way contains between 200-400 billion stars: Our galaxy is just one of billions in the observable universe.
                3. Shooting stars are actually meteors: Small particles of debris entering Earth's atmosphere, burning up, and producing
                a bright streak of light.
                
                Atmospheric Phenomena
                
                1. The atmosphere extends far beyond what we can see: It reaches a height of about 10,000 km (6,200 miles), with the
                Karman line (100 km/62 miles) marking the edge of space.
                2. Lightning can reach temperatures of up to 30,000°C: That's five times hotter than the surface of the sun.
                3. The sky can display a range of colors during sunrise and sunset: Due to the scattering of light by atmospheric
                particles, we can see hues of red, orange, pink, and purple.
                
                Cultural and Historical Facts
                
                1. The ancient Greeks believed the sky was made of crystal: They thought the stars and planets were embedded in this
                crystal dome.
                2. Many cultures have mythological explanations for the sky's color: For example, in Norse mythology, the sky is said to
                be the cloak of the god Odin.
                3. The first satellite launched into space was Sputnik 1 in 1957: It marked the beginning of the space age and our
                exploration of the sky.
                
                These facts showcase the awe-inspiring beauty and complexity of the sky.
